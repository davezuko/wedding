            Fate brought Jackie and David together in the fall of 2014 in true
            modern day fashion, on the trusty dating app, OkCupid. David had
            just finished school at Western Michigan University and moved into
            his first apartment in Birmingham, Michigan. Jackie was a social
            work student at Oakland University and worked as a soccer coach at
            the time. Not long after they started chatting on OkCupid, David
            picked Jackie up from her parents house and they went to a local
            park to eat a Little Ceasers pizza and get to know one another.
            Jackie was impressed with Davidâ€™s intelligence and sense of
            adventure. They quickly realised that they had grown up less than a
            quarter mile from each other but had never knowingly crossed paths
            due to the county divide.{' '}
